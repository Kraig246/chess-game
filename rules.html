    <h1>How to Play</h1>

        <h2>Knowing Your Pieces</h2>
            <p class="rulesp">In Chess, it is vital to know the pieces you are playing with and how to use them. This guide will show you how to properly use your pieces according to the proper rules of the game.</p>
        <h3>The King</h3>
            <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/86/King_Chess.jpg" height="120" width="60" alt="Image of a King piece" class="chessimg">
        <p class="rulesp">The King is the most important piece in the game. It can only make moves where it can without putting itself in danger of being in check. The King can move in any direction, but only one tile at a time, so use this piece with extreme caution.</p>
        <h3>The Rook</h3>
            <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/20/Rook_%28Chess%29_kopio.jpg" height="120" width="60" alt="Image of a Rook piece" class="chessimg">
        <p class="rulesp">The Rook is a piece that moves horizontally or vertically in any number of unoccupied spaces. It can also participate in a special move with the King called "castling".</p>
        <h3>The Knight</h3>
            <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/37/Knight_Chess.jpg" height="120" width="60" alt="Image of a Knight piece" class="chessimg">
        <p class="rulesp">The Knight is a piece that can move in any direction. However, it can only move two tiles forward and then one to the side in an L shape. This is also the only piece in the game that can jump over other pieces to reach unoccupied tiles or eliminate other pieces.</p>
        <h3>The Bishop</h3>
            <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/73/Bishop_Chess.jpg" height="120" width="60" alt="Image of a Bishop piece" class="chessimg">
        <p class="rulesp">The Bishop is a piece that can move in any number of tiles diagonally as long as it isn't obstructed by other pieces. Bishops that begin on light tiles can only move on light tiles, and the same rules apply in the case of dark tiles.</p>
        <h3>The Pawn</h3>
            <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/09/Pawn_Chess.jpg" height="120" width="60" alt="Image of a Pawn piece" class="chessimg">
        <p class="rulesp">The pawn is the most auxiliary piece in the game. At the start of the game, it can move either one tile forward or two tiles forward. They can be used for attack or defense. However, the pawn is the only piece in the game that cannot move backwards. If you can get a Pawn to the other side of the board, it has the unique ability called promotion in which it can become a Queen, Bishop, Rook, or Knight. Pawns can only capture other pieces if they are one tile diagonally from them.</p>
        <h3>The Queen</h3>
            <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a0/Queen_Chess.jpg" height="120" width="60" alt="Image of a Queen piece" class="chessimg">
        <p class="rulesp">Last but not least, the Queen is the most powerful piece in a player's arsenal. This piece can be moved in any number of unoccupied tiles in any straight line be it vertically, horizontally, or diagonally which essentially makes it like a combination of the Rook and Bishop. Use this piece wisely and it may mean the difference between victory and defeat.</p>
        <h3>Castling</h3>
                <img src="https://www.chessable.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/kingside.jpg" height="150" width="150" alt="A visual representation of castling" class="chessimg">
            <p class="rulesp">Castling in Chess is a special move to protect your King and activate your Rook. In order to do this, the King and Rook must not have moved from their starting points. Then, all spaces between the King and Rook have to be empty and the King can't be in check. Finally, the tile that the King passes over can't be under attack.</p>
        <h3>How to Win</h3>
            <img src="https://images.chesscomfiles.com/uploads/v1/article/24256.f446db09.668x375o.a367c450ba18@2x.jpeg" height="150" width="200" alt="Picture of elimination in chess" class="chessimg">
            <p class="rulesp">Eliminating other pieces in chess is crucial to a win. If a piece's move ends on a tile that contains the opponent's piece, that piece is eliminated from the game. The only piece that cannot be captured is the King.<br> Whenever the King is in danger, it will go into "check" in which the King must either move to safety, or have another piece guard the king. Once the King has no more safe moves, it is considered a checkmate, and the game is over.</p>
          <h3>Remove pieces when eliminated</h3>
          <p>When you eliminate a white piece as a black piece move the white piece you eliminated to the top box that has a white border. If you eliminated a black piece as a white piece move the black piece you eliminated to the bottom box with a black border.</p>
